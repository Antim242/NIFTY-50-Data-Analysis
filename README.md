# **Documentation: NIFTY 50 Data Analysis**

## **Objective**
The goal of this task was to create a Python script to fetch and analyze NIFTY 50 data from NSE India. The script performs the following tasks:

1. Find the top 5 gainers and losers of the day.
2. Identify 5 stocks that are currently 30% below their 52-week high.
3. Identify 5 stocks that are currently 20% above their 52-week low.
4. Determine the stocks that have given the highest returns in the last 30 days.
5. Create a bar chart for the top 5 gainers and losers.

Additionally, this document details the approach used, the script development process, and the final output.

## **Development Approach**

### **Step 1: Fetching NIFTY 50 Data**
A function was created to fetch data using the `requests` library with proper headers and retries to ensure successful API calls.

---

### **Step 2: Data Processing and Filtering**
The script was modified to extract the top 5 gainers and losers based on percentage change (`pChange`). Additionally, it identifies 5 stocks that are 30% below their 52-week high and 5 stocks that are 20% above their 52-week low.

---

### **Step 3: Adding a 30-Day Returns Calculation**
The script calculates and returns the stocks that have given the highest returns in the last 30 days, handling missing values gracefully.

---

### **Step 4: Creating a Visualization**
A `matplotlib` bar chart was generated and saved to visualize the top 5 gainers and losers of the day.

| GHI    | -3.2%   |
| JKL    | -3.1%   |
| MNO    | -2.9%   |

### **Stocks 30% Below 52-Week High:**

| LMN    | -31.2%       |
| PQR    | -30.9%       |
| DEF    | -30.5%       |

### **Stocks 20% Above 52-Week Low:**
| Symbol | Difference (%) |
|--------|--------------|
| UVW    | +22.1%       |
| RST    | +21.9%       |
| GHI    | +21.5%       |
| JKL    | +21.3%       |
| MNO    | +20.7%       |
